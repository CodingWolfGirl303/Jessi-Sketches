    <h3> Hi, I'm Jessi. I've wanted to be an artist since I was very young, so I decided to create my own shops on websites such as Redbubble, Threadless, etc. to sell my art as designs on a variety of products. Thanks for supporting my journey by stopping by my website! Make sure to check out my artwork, my shops can be found by clicking the buttons below! </h3>
